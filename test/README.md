## Unit test

A unit test is a type of software testing that focuses on verifying the correctness and functionality of individual units or components of a software system. A unit, in this context, refers to the smallest testable part of an application, such as a function, method, or class.

Each testing function must be: 

1. **Functionality**: Tests should verify the correct functionality of the function. 
2. **Accuracy**: Accuracy testing ensures that the function produces correct and precise results.
3. **Reliability**: Reliability testing assesses the function's ability to consistently deliver accurate results *over time*. 
4. **Usability**: Usability testing focuses on the user experience and ease of use
